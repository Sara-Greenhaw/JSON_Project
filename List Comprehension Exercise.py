'''List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. 

It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then
zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can
put in all kinds of objects in lists.

The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the
context of the for and if clauses which follow it. 

The list comprehension always returns a result list. '''


'''
new_list = []
for i in original_list:
    if filter(i):
        new_list.append(expressions(i))  '''

#You can obtain the same thing using list comprehension:

# new_list = [expression(i) for i in original_list if filter(i)]


#The list comprehension starts with a '[' and ']', to help you remember that the
#result is going to be a list.

# [ expression for item in list if conditional ]

# This is equivalent to:

'''for item in list:
    if conditional:
        expression '''
		
		


#Which corresponds to:

#*result*  = [*transform*    *iteration*         *filter*     ]

#The * operator is used to repeat. The filter part answers the question if the
#item should be transformed. '''















## Exercise ##

# 1 Using a list comprehension, create a new list called "newlist" out of the list "numbers", 
# which contains only the positive numbers from the list, as integers.

numbers = [34.6, -203.4, 44.9, 68.3, -12.2, 44.6, 12.7]




## 2 create a list of integers which specify the length of each word in
## a sentence except for the word 'the'

sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
words = sentence.split()



## Given dictionary is consisted of vehicles and their weights in kilograms. 
## Contruct a list of the names of vehicles with weight below 5000 kilograms. 
## In the same list comprehension make the key names all upper case.

dict={"Sedan": 1500, "SUV": 2000, "Pickup": 2500, "Minivan": 1600, "Van": 2400, 
"Semi": 13600, "Bicycle": 7, "Motorcycle": 110}
